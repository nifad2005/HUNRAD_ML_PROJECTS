100 Days, 100 ML Projects Mission.

Under this mission, I am undertaking 100 Machine Learning projects in 100 days.
This journey began on July 5, 2025, and is set to conclude on October 13, 2025.

Through these 100 diverse projects, my goal is to solidify Machine Learning concepts by gaining extensive hands-on experience and building a robust portfolio. Each project aims to enhance daily learning, practical application, and problem-solving skills, fostering consistency in my ML journey.

Keep Learning!
